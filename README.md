[![SWUbanner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vshymanskyy/StandWithUkraine/main/banner-direct-single.svg)](https://stand-with-ukraine.pp.ua/)

[üá∫üá¶ –Ü–Ω—Å—Ç—Ä—É–∫—Ü—ñ—è —É–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–æ—é](https://github.com/sverdlyuk/glados_ukr/blob/main/README_ukr.md). This voice pack lets your robot vacuum speak using the voice of GLaDOS ‚Äî the artificial intelligence from Portal 2, known for her sarcasm, superiority complex, and dark humor.  
The project was made possible with [financial support](https://dou.ua/forums/topic/50353/) from the Ukrainian community.

## üöÄFeatures

The phrases have been rewritten with GLaDOS's signature dark humor and toxic personality ‚Äî without losing the original meaning.

## üéôÔ∏è How to create your own Dreame voice pack
- Prepare `.ogg` files, 16,000 Hz, Stereo/Mono according to the [phrase table](https://github.com/oleksandr-belei/dreame-vacuum-uk-voice-packs/blob/main/ua_voice_mapping.csv). You can create only 5-10 of the most popular phrases. Other phrases will be taken from the donor pack.

- Download any existing voice pack: [GLaDOS_ukr](https://github.com/sverdlyuk/glados_ukr/raw/refs/heads/main/uk_glados_voice_pack.gz), [uk_female_pensive](https://github.com/oleksandr-belei/dreame-vacuum-uk-voice-packs/raw/refs/heads/main/voice_packs/uk_female_pensive), [dreame_female_uk](https://awsde0.fds.api.xiaomi.com/dreame-product/resources/59bcaf5201f15950c12917d0bb505321), [Les Poderevyansky](https://github.com/KonstantinDev7/Voice_Packs_for_Mi_Robot_S10_Plus/raw/refs/heads/main/Voice_Packs/LesV1ogg.tar.gz). A voice pack is a tar.gz archive. For example, the GLaDOS_ukr voice pack has a .gz extension. To open the archive, rename the extension from `.tar` to `tar.gz`. Similarly, you can add the extension to a pack that has no extension. Open the archive (on MacOS I used BetterZip) and replace the archive files with your own. Note: the archive must contain only files, not a folder with files.

- Upload the voice pack somewhere online to get a link to the file. For example, a public repository on GitHub, GitLab, FTP server, etc. Find out the file size in bytes and the md5 checksum of the file. If you don‚Äôt know how to do this, you can use online services.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installing the Roborock Voice Pack
[Demo video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/RhcbOiGvVik?feature=share). This voice pack is intended to work on Roborock robot vacuums of the 1st and 2nd generation (v1, M1S, S4, S5, S5e, S6, S6_MaxV, S6_Pure, T6). I tested it on v1 (rockrobo.vacuum.v1, same as Gen 1 Xiaomi Mi SDJQRO2RR). Third-generation vacuums have voice packs signed with the Roborock certificate. Because of this, installing custom voice packs is not possible.

To install the voice pack:
1. Download [roborock_glados.pkg](https://github.com/sverdlyuk/glados_ukr/raw/refs/heads/main/roborock_glados.pkg) to your computer;
2. Install [python-miio](https://github.com/rytilahti/python-miio);
3. In the command line, in the folder with roborock_glados.pkg, run the command
```python
mirobo --ip 192.168.0.124 --token 50597y49p1894f6d6e67477349747408 install-sound roborock_glados.pkg
```
where `192.168.0.124` should be replaced with the IP address of your robot vacuum, and `50597y49p1894f6d6e67477349747408` with your robot vacuum's token. You can find the token using the command `python -m miio.cli cloud list` (Windows), `miiocli cloud list` (Linux, MacOS), or any other convenient method like [this one](https://github.com/PiotrMachowski/Xiaomi-cloud-tokens-extractor).

## üéôÔ∏è How to create your own Roborock voice pack
To create your own voice pack, you need to:
1. Create or download files in .wav format, bitrate 1411.2 KB/s, sample rate 44.1 or 16.0 kHz;
2. Download the encryption utility [ccrypt](https://ccrypt.sourceforge.net);
3. In the command line, in the folder with the files, run the command
```
tar zc *.wav | ccrypt -e -K "r0ckrobo#23456" > roborock_glados.pkg
```
where `roborock_glados` should be replaced with any name you want for your voice pack.
6. Done! You can upload the created .pkg file to your robot vacuum.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installing the Midea M7 Pro Voice Pack
* Download [SDK Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools) to your PC and extract them to any convenient folder.
* Connect the robot to your PC. The USB port is located under the top cover beneath the Reset button, hidden behind a plug.
* Open the command line in the extracted Platform Tools folder (right-click -> Open in Terminal) and run the command ```adb devices``` to make sure your device is recognized. If you see your device ID, everything is fine; if not, your cable may not support data transfer (I tried several cables I had and only one worked).
* Then download the [voice pack](https://github.com/sverdlyuk/glados_ukr/raw/refs/heads/main/GLaDOS%20Midea.zip) and extract it to any folder convenient for you.
* Create a text file in the Platform Tools folder with the following code:
```
@echo off
set SOURCE_FOLDER=full path to the folder with sounds
for /r ‚Äú%SOURCE_FOLDER%‚Äù %%x in (*) do (
set ‚Äúfile=%%x‚Äù
setlocal enabledelayedexpansion
set ‚Äúpath=!file:%SOURCE_FOLDER%=!‚Äù
adb push ‚Äú%%x‚Äù ‚Äú/oem/sound/!path!‚Äù
endlocal
)
```
* Change the file extension from .txt to .bat, then run it.
* Done!

## üéôÔ∏è How to create your own Midea M7 Pro voice pack
To create your own voice pack for Midea, simply prepare a folder with audio files in .mp3 format. Each file must meet the following specifications:
* Bitrate: 64 kbps (audio compression quality)
* Channels: mono (single-channel audio)
* Sample rate: 48000 Hz (number of audio samples per second)
File names must correspond to the numbers they represent. More details are in the [Midea command mapping file](https://github.com/sverdlyuk/glados_ukr/blob/main/midea_glados_uk_mapping.csv).
For convenience, here are the [original Midea M7 Pro sound files](https://github.com/sverdlyuk/glados_ukr/tree/main/Other%20files/original).

## üéôÔ∏è How to create your own Xiaomi voice pack
A Xiaomi voice pack is a `tar.gz` archive containing `.mp3` files without folders (all files are placed directly in the root of the archive). All files are named with numbers. Each number corresponds to a specific phrase. See more details in the [Xiaomi command mapping](https://github.com/sverdlyuk/glados_ukr/blob/main/xiaomi_glados_uk_mapping.csv). The file bitrate is 96 kbps. The sample rate is 44.1 kHz or 16.0 kHz.

There is a difference in quality between low bitrate (e.g., 32 kbps) and higher bitrate (e.g., 96 or 120 kbps), but for short voice phrases it is almost unnoticeable. Therefore, it is recommended to use a bitrate in the range of 100‚Äì120 kbps for an optimal balance between quality and file size.
